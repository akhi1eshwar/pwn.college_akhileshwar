# reading manuals

### in this challenge we read the manuals for files

**Flag** 'pwn.college{U1VdJsEKXtC-Llujydsh_j4lFnR.QX0EDO0wSO1gjNzEzW}'

in this challenge i had to use man challenge to pull out the manual for challenge and in that were the instructions for how to retrieve the flag 
i simply had to put in the command /challenge/challenge --dstluj 140 and i got the flag.


```
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --dstluj 140
