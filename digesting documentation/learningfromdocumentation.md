# Learning from documentation
## this challenge makes us aware about proper sepcifications of running program thorugh arguments

**Flag** 'pwn.college{wX3zk0k8BEScC-7LppaHmGo4RU8.QX0ITO0wSO1gjNzEzW}'


in this exercise, i simply used the commands the challenged asked me to do. by  using /challenge/challenge i reached the file and by using --giveflag, i specified what to do.

```
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wX3zk0k8BEScC-7LppaHmGo4RU8.QX0ITO0wSO1gjNzEzW}
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ 
```

## What i Learnt
i learnt how to properly operate on the terminal to ask stuff from the files.
the file challenge does exist but simply invoking it wouldn't do anything.
by giving the argument --giveflag, it will give us the flag.

also as we did in previous exercises "ls -a", the -a is the argument to display hidden files.

#references
none.
