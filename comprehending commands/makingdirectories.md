# Making Directories
### this exercise challenges us to make a directory and make a file in it

**Flag** 'pwn.college{45bDgqFWKMPEy4NnUso1x9xMCUN.QXxMDO0wSO1gjNzEzW}'

using the mkdir command i created the directory /tmp/pwn
and then changing directories to /tmp/pwn i created a new file called college using touch
ran /challenge/run to get the flag

```
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{45bDgqFWKMPEy4NnUso1x9xMCUN.QXxMDO0wSO1gjNzEzW}
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ 

```
