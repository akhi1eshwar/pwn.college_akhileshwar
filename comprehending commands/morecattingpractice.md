# More Catting Practive
## this challenge makes us do one more catting exercise

**Flag** 'pwn.college{Q1swxzDNWfaVStnjgWj3laFn1nE.QXwITO0wSO1gjNzEzW}'

in this challenge we were restricted from using the cd command so we couldn't change the directories and simply use cat flag to get the flag. 
instead what we had to do was get the flag using its absolute path, which was a bit longer this time.

```
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/include/netatalk/flag
pwn.college{Q1swxzDNWfaVStnjgWj3laFn1nE.QXwITO0wSO1gjNzEzW}
```
