# Listing Files
### this challenge asks you to lists files in a directory

in this challenge i had to use to ls command on /challenge directory to get the names of the files in the directory. this gave me the names.
the run file that is usually there was renamed to 12435-renamed-run-17117. so i just located to it through the /commands and got the flag.

earlier i was having trouble doing so because i was using the cat command it gave me the message but not the flag.


```
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge
12435-renamed-run-17117  DESCRIPTION.md
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/12435-renamed-run-17117
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
