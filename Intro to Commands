#Intro To Commands
### in this challenge we learn commands in linux terminal

**Flag** 'pwn.college{ksvtDRxbXqHQn3vj1P1KGmlYl9Q.QX3YjM1wSO1gjNzEzW}'

to get the flag, first the whoami command was used, to which the response of the terminal was "hacker"
after that the command hello had to be used, to which the terminal responded with the flag.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ksvtDRxbXqHQn3vj1P1KGmlYl9Q.QX3YjM1wSO1gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
in this challenge, i learnt about the commands in command line or the "shell"
We input commands into the terminal to get the required informatiion/response from the terminal.
I learnt what the whoami command does, which is that it tells you who is the person using the commandline.
