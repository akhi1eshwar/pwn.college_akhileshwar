# Command History
### finding the previous commands you have entered in the shell

**Flag** 'pwn.college{c9tXILDNh0MUQ1_NaJwOfKiTonp.0lNzEzNxwSO1gjNzEzW}'

this challenge didn't require much work. the flag was embedded in the command history already and we only have to go through the commands using the arrow key..

no code snippet in this one.

##what i learned

how to access the previous commands i may have entered very quickly, otherwise scrolling or thiking extensively can become time consuming and annoying.
command history makes everything more convenient.

## references
none.
